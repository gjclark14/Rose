Because I'm not creative I'm going back to [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)


This time however I'll be keeping everything tightly organized and doing my best to create libraries along the way for longetivity of the project.


Languages to be used: python, c/c++, java - but I'm guessing primarily python.


Maybe I'll get to a gui for this? I'd like to take a look at different algorithms for solving applicable problems if possible. I'd also love to create 
a glossary with all terms found along the way.
